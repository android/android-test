"""A useful class for digesting, on a high-level, where time in a program goes.

Usage:

sw = StopWatch()
sw.start()
sw.start('foo')
foo()
sw.stop('foo')
args = overhead_code()
sw.start('bar')
bar(args)
sw.stop('bar')
sw.dump()

If you start a new timer when one is already running, then the other one will
stop running, and restart when you stop this timer.  This behavior is very
useful for when you want to try timing for a subcall without remembering
what is already running.  For instance:

sw.start('all_this')
do_some_stuff()
sw.start('just_that')
small_but_expensive_function()
sw.stop('just_that')
cleanup_code()
sw.stop('all_this')

In this case, the output will be what you want:  the time spent in
small_but_expensive function will show up in the timer for just_that and not
all_this.
