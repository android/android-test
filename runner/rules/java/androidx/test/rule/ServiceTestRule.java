/**
 * A JUnit rule that provides a simplified mechanism to start and shutdown your service before and
 * after the duration of your test. It also guarantees that the service is successfully connected
 * when starting (or binding to) a service. The service can be started (or bound) using one of the
 * helper methods. It will automatically be stopped (or unbound) after the test completes and any
 * methods annotated with <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/After.html"><code>
 * After</code></a> are finished.
 *
 * <p>Note: This rule doesn't support {@link android.app.IntentService} because it's automatically
 * destroyed when {@link android.app.IntentService#onHandleIntent(android.content.Intent)} finishes
 * all outstanding commands. So there is no guarantee to establish a successful connection in a
 * timely manner.
 *
 * <p>Usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Rule
 * public final ServiceTestRule mServiceRule = new ServiceTestRule();
 *
 * &#064;Test
 * public void testWithStartedService() {
 *     mServiceRule.startService(
 *         new Intent(InstrumentationRegistry.getTargetContext(), MyService.class));
 *     //do something
 * }
 *
 * &#064;Test
 * public void testWithBoundService() {
 *     IBinder binder = mServiceRule.bindService(
 *         new Intent(InstrumentationRegistry.getTargetContext(), MyService.class));
 *     MyService service = ((MyService.LocalBinder) binder).getService();
 *     assertTrue("True wasn't returned", service.doSomethingToReturnTrue());
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <p><b>This API is currently in beta.</b>
