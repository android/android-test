This GitHub project hosts two somewhat distinct projects: 
1. AndroidX Test libraries
2. Bazel support for android_instrumentation_test

# AndroidX Test Libraries

The AndroidX Test Library provides an extensive framework for testing Android apps. This library provides a set of APIs that allow you to quickly build and run test code for your apps, including JUnit 4 and functional user interface (UI) tests. You can run tests created using these APIs from the Android Studio IDE or from the command line.All packages in AndroidX live in a consistent namespace starting with the string androidx. The Support Library packages have been mapped into corresponding androidx.* packages. For a full mapping of all the old classes and build artifacts to the new ones, see the Package Refactoring page.

For more details see [developers.android.com/testing](https://developers.android.com/testing)

The following maven libraries are hosted in this repo:

androidx.test:annotation
androidx.test:core
androidx.test.espresso*
androidx.test.ext:junit
androidx.test:orchestrator
androidx.test:runner
androidx.test:rules
androidx.test:services

androidx.test.uiautomator and androidx.test:ext:junit-gtest are hosted on [AOSP](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main/README.md)
