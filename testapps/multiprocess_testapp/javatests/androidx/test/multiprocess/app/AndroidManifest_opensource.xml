      The following is used by AndroidJUnitRunner (AJUR) to init Espresso in the new PID. This
      is mandatory and is required because AJUR is automatically instantiated by the Android
      framework itself since it's simply an Instrumentation. However, Espresso is just a testing
      framework that is used by AJUR so it's responsible to instantiate it on the remote process
      in order for handle all the actions from the original process.
