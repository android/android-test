## Building and Testing

AndroidX Test uses the [bazel](https://bazel.build/) build system.

### One time setup

 * [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the [AndroidX Test repo](https://github.com/android/android-test)
 * Install [bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html). Version 0.17.2 is recommended. Ensure your environment meets the following [prerequisites](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/android-instrumentation-test.html#prerequisites)
 * Install [maven](http://maven.apache.org/install.html) and make it available on PATH.
 * Install the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) and run the following command to ensure you have the necessary components:
 ```
 ./tools/bin/sdkmanager --install 'build-tools;28.0.3' 'platforms;android-28' 'emulator' 'platform-tools' 'system-images;android-19;default;x86' 'system-images;android-21;default;x86' 'system-images;android-22;default;x86' 'system-images;android-23;default;x86'
 ```
 * Set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to point to the SDK install location. eg
```
 export ANDROID_HOME=/home/$USER/Android/Sdk
```

### Building

```
bazel build <target path>
```

For example, to build the AndroidX Test maven repository:
```
bazel build :axt_m2repository
```

### Testing

```
bazel test <target path> --spawn_strategy=local
```

eg to run the androidx-test-core tests
```
bazel test //core/javatests/â€¦ --spawn_strategy=local
```

To run all the robolectric/local tests: `bazel test ...
--test_tag_filters=robolectric --build_tag_filters=robolectric`
