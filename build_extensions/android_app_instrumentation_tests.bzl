    """A macro for an instrumentation test whose target under test is an android_binary.

    The intent of this wrapper is to simplify the build API for creating instrumentation test rules
    for simple cases, while still supporting build_cleaner for automatic dependency management.

    This will generate:
      - a test_lib android_library, containing all sources and dependencies
      - a test_binary android_binary (soon to be android_application)
      - the manifest to use for the test library.
      - for each src + device combination:
         - a android_instrumentation_test rule

    Args:
      name: the name to use for the generated android_library rule. This is needed for build_cleaner to
        manage dependencies
      binary_target: the android_binary under test
      srcs: the test sources to generate rules for
      deps: the build dependencies to use for the generated test library
      device_list: list of device structs to execute on, generated from phone_devices.bzl:devices().
          By default this method returns a device for each available API level
      test_java_package: Optional. A custom root package name to use for the tests. If unset
          will be derived based on current path to a java source root
      binary_target_package: Optional: the android package name of binary_target. If unset, will be
          derived from binary target's path to a java source root
      library_args: additional arguments to pass to generated android_library
      binary_args: additional arguments to pass to generated android_binary
      **kwargs: arguments to pass to generated android_instrumentation_test rules
